    "GAIA is arguably the most comprehensive benchmark for agents. Its questions are very difficult and hit on many challenges of LLM-based systems. Here is an example of a hard question:\n",

    "`Which of the fruits shown in the 2008 painting \"Embroidery from Uzbekistan\" were served as part of the October 1949 breakfast menu for the ocean liner that was later used as a floating prop for the film \"The Last Voyage\"? Give the items as a comma-separated list, ordering them in clockwise order based on their arrangement in the painting starting from the 12 o'clock position. Use the plural form of each fruit.`\n",

    "* Answering in a constrained format,\n",

    "* Finding which ocean liner was used as a floating prop for “The Last Voyage”\n",
    "* Finding the October 1949 breakfast menu for the above ocean liner\n",
    "* Chaining together a problem-solving trajectory in the correct order.\n",
    "* Solving this requires both high-level planning abilities and rigorous execution, which are two areas where LLMs struggle when used alone.\n",

On the other side of the spectrum, with Deep Research, OpenAI reached 67.36% score on the validation set, so an order of magnitude better! (Though we don’t know how they would actually fare on the private test set.)"
